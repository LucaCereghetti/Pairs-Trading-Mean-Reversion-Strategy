    "# Pairs Trading Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Pairs trading is a classic example of a strategy based on mathematical analysis. The principle is as follows. Let's say you have a pair of securities X and Y that have some underlying economic link. An example might be two companies that manufacture the same product, or two companies in one supply chain. If we can model this economic link with a mathematical model, we can make trades on it. We'll start by constructing a toy example.\n",

    "The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is a statistical tool used to assess the stationarity of a time series. Stationarity is a key concept in time series analysis, indicating whether the statistical properties of the series, such as mean and variance, remain constant over time. Non-stationary series can display trends or seasonal patterns, potentially influencing the results of various time series models and analyses. We are conducting the ADF test on each asset to evaluate its stationarity, which is crucial for further analysis, including cointegration testing and the development of robust trading strategies. In this section, we will verify if each asset is non-stationary individually, as the concept of cointegration applies only to non-stationary time series."
